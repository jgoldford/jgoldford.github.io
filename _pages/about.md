I am a Physics of Living Systems Fellow in the department of Physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  I completed my Ph.D. in the Bioinformatics Program from Boston University working with Daniel Segre and Pankaj Mehta, as well as Alvaro Sanchez( Yale), and my M.S. in Microbial Engineering from the University of Minnesota. I use theory and computational modeling to study how the environment constrains the evolution of metabolic networks and shapes the structure of microbial communities.  Below are some thoughts and questions that motivate me in these research areas.

The origin and early evolution of living systems
------
The transition from prebiotic chemistry to a complex biochemical network capable of sustaining life on early Earth is a major unresolved enigma. It is unclear how metabolism could have originated and evolved, given the limited geochemical availability of complex biomolecules in ancient environments.  

I am interested in integrating multi-scale network analysis, physicochemical constraints, and geochemical support for the composition of ancient biomolecules and environments, to reconstruct plausible trajectories of metabolic evolution.  I am
